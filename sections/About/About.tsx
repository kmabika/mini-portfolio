          Software development has always been my passion and hobby since
          highschool. Growing up, whenever someone asked me what my dream was, I
          would always say, ‚ÄúI want to be an developer‚Äù. I was constantly
          immersed in problem solving activities. While in the midst of all
          that, web development started to become a big part of my life as well,
          and my interest in the constantly evolving frontend ecosystem
          continued to grow.

          To me, development is a problem solving activity. As an aspiring
          developer, I understand that the perfect app not only involves
          functionality, but even more importantly, an interface that functions
          well. This requires a deep understanding of core development practices
          and creativity - the outcome of which greatly impacts the overall
          experience of the application.

          I enjoy working on projects that change the and take advantage of the
          mordern web. I love working on problems from the idea stage and seeing
          them through completion On a team level, I strive to work with
          individuals who have the same goals and standards as me, because I
          genuinely enjoy the effectiveness a well-oilled team produces. I dream
          to become a domain expert in my field with being able to üöÄ ship
          exiting projects.
